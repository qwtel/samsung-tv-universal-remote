# Samsung TV Universal Remote

Combines the [`samsung-remote`][legacy] and [`samsung-tv-remote`][tizen] packages into one module under a unified, promise-based API.

Exposes as "factory" that will detect support for either Tizen (WebSocket) or Legacy (socket) Samsung TVs and return the corresponding remote class.

**SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS"**

**NOT AFFILIATED WITH SAMSUNG**
